## Description

A scenic coastal walk along the Fife Coast Path, connecting the charming seaside village of Aberdour to the historic town of Kirkcaldy via Burntisland. The route combines sandy beaches with dramatic rock formations, offering stunning views across the Firth of Forth.

The first section from Aberdour is relatively gentle, following the shore past Silver Sands beach.

The walk finishes near Kirkcaldy's waterfront with cafés and facilities nearby.
