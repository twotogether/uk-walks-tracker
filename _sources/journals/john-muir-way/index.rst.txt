John Muir Way
=============

The John Muir Way is one of Scotland's great long-distance walking routes, stretching 134 miles (216 km) coast to coast from Helensburgh in the west to Dunbar in the east. Named after the Scottish-born naturalist and conservationist John Muir (who was born in Dunbar), this trail traverses central Scotland and showcases diverse landscapes including woodlands, beaches, canals, rivers, parks, and historic sites. The route symbolically passes through Scotland's Loch Lomond & The Trossachs National Park and features Roman heritage, engineering landmarks, and UNESCO World Heritage sites.

The walks documented here focus on the eastern sections of the John Muir Way, a particularly scenic stretch that follows the Firth of Forth coastline and coastal paths. This section is known for its stunning views, historic sites, and charming coastal villages.
