## Description

From the bus stop, head east past the historic Hawes Inn and beneath the towering, rust-red Forth Bridge. From there, the route takes you through the picturesque Roseberry Estate, also known as Dalmeny Estate. As you continue, the path weaves along the coast before passing the impressive Dalmeny House. From here, the trail moves on towards the village of Cramond, where the peaceful surroundings offer a calm introduction to Edinburgh. The route then heads through the quiet neighbourhoods of Cramond and Barnton, before climbing Corstorphine Hill — one of the highest points on the eastern section of the John Muir Way.

From here, the walk takes you onward, along the scenic paths along the Water of Leith toward Slateford, where your journey finishes.
