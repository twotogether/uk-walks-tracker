## Description

A scenic and relatively flat walk from Edinburgh to Ratho along the Union Canal, one of Scotland's most picturesque waterways. The route follows the historic towpath from Edinburgh's city centre to the village of Ratho, passing through quiet suburbs and countryside sections with views of the surrounding landscape.

The Union Canal is a testament to Scotland's industrial heritage, originally [built in the 1820s](https://www.scottishcanals.co.uk/visit/canals/visit-the-union-canal/history-heritage) to connect Edinburgh with the Forth and Clyde Canal. The walk offers a peaceful escape from the city while remaining easily accessible from the centre. Perfect for families and those seeking a gentle outing with nature.

## Historic Sights

Along the way, you'll pass several impressive historic structures:

- **Leamington Lift Bridge** - The [Leamington Lift Bridge](https://threadinburgh.scot/2022/09/18/the-thread-about-the-early-history-of-the-union-canal-when-it-came-into-edinburgh-why-the-leamington-lift-bridge-wasnt-always-at-leamington-and-what-became-of-its-ports/) is a historic movable bridge located near Fountainbridge, Edinburgh. It was designed to lift to allow boats to pass, a mechanism common to many of the canals built during the Industrial Revolution. The bridge still operates today and is considered an important piece of Edinburgh's canal history.
- **Slateford Aqueduct** - The Slateford Aqueduct is part of the Union Canal, which connects Edinburgh to the central belt of Scotland. The aqueduct spans the Water of Leith and was completed in 1822. It is a notable feat of engineering from the early 19th century and is still in use today.
- **Prince Charlie Aqueduct** - Long been rumored to be named after Bonnie Prince Charlie due to his historical connection to the region and the Jacobite movement.
- **Scott Russell Aqueduct** - This aqueduct spans the Edinburgh Bypass (A720), not the Water of Leith, and it’s a key Victorian engineering feature designed by John Scott Russell.
  
## Notes

- **Cafes, Restaurants, Pubs, and Grocery Shops**: 
  - Cafés and shops at the start in Edinburgh.
  - Limited facilities along the way but their is an ASDA and a Sainsbury's at Slateford a short detour from the canal.
  - `The Bridge Inn` at Ratho is a good stop for a drink. If you are planing to eat here, book ahead. 
- **Public Toilets**: None at start. Lothian Road has several pubs and cafes. There is a public toilet at the Water of Leith visitor centre cafe (open 10 am to 4 pm and donations encouraged). No public toilets in Ratho.
- **Safety**: Watch for cyclists on the towpath; most are considerate, but stay alert.
- **Wildlife**: Look out for kingfishers, herons, and other waterfowl along the canal.
