Union Canal
===========

The Union Canal is one of Scotland's most picturesque inland waterways, stretching from Edinburgh to Falkirk. This historic canal, built in the early 19th century, features a peaceful towpath ideal for leisurely walks. The canal passes through charming villages, alongside historic sites, and through scenic countryside, making it a perfect destination for walkers of all abilities.

We walked the length of the Union Canal, starting from Edinburgh and ending in Linlithgow, and have compiled a series of walks that highlight the best of this beautiful waterway. Whether you're looking for a short stroll or a longer hike, there's something for everyone along the Union Canal.

- **Total Distance**: 31 miles (51 km) (Edinburgh to Falkirk)
- **Start**: Edinburgh at Lochrin Basin
- **End**: Falkirk at Falkirk Wheel

**UNION CANAL SECTIONS**: We usually walk in short sections of approximately 10-12 KM because (a) it allows us to be more mindful and enjoy the scenery, (b) we want to enjoy the walk and not feel rushed or exhausted and that is our sweet spot in terms of distance. We try to provide information on alternate access points should you desire a shorter/longer walk.

1. `Edinburgh to Ratho <edinburgh-to-ratho.html>`_ | 13.4 KM
