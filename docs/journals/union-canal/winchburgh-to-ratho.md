## Description

1. **Start at Sainsbury’s Winchburgh & Join the Towpath**: Begin your walk from the Sainsbury’s area in Winchburgh and pick up the canal towpath heading east-south-east. This towpath is part of the Shale Trail, following the historic shale oil-industry landscape.

2. **Shale Bings & Niddry Castle Views**: Early on, you’ll see distinctive shale bings (industrial spoil heaps) on both sides of the canal, remnants of West Lothian’s shale industry. The 16th-century Niddry Castle sits near the canal to the left as you leave Winchburgh.

3. **Cross Broxburn Area on the Shale Trail**: Continue along the towpath through the Broxburn stretch; the route remains on the broadly level Shale Trail and retains these industrial heritage features as you walk toward Ratho. We walk under the M8 and railway bridge. 

4. **Almond Aqueduct & Pleasant Woodlands**: Ahead of Ratho is Almond Aqueduct (also called Lin's Mill Aqueduct) a scenic stone structure carrying the canal over the River Almond. Around here the towpath passes attractive stretches of woodland and farmland, offering a peaceful and scenic section of the walk.

5. **Ratho Quarry & Finish at Ratho Bridge Inn**: Just before the end of the walk, you’ll pass Ratho Quarry, known today for its huge former quarry site and the Edinburgh International Climbing Arena. Conclude your canal walk by the Ratho Bridge Inn, just off the canal where you can leave the towpath and rest.

## Historic Sights

- **Niddry Castle**: Near Winchburgh you’ll see the 16th-century Niddry Castle, a historic tower house built around 1500 by the Seton family. It played a role in Scottish history, including sheltering Mary, Queen of Scots in 1568 after her escape from captivity and surviving attacks during the civil war of the 1570s.

- **Shale Bings**: The striking red shale bings you pass through Winchburgh and Broxburn are remnants of Scotland’s oil shale industry of the 19th and early 20th centuries. These huge waste heaps came from shale extraction and processing that helped power the early oil boom in the area.

- **Almond Aqueduct (Lin's Mill Aqueduct)**: This elegant stone aqueduct — designed by Hugh Baird with input from famed engineer Thomas Telford — carries the canal high over the River Almond just west of Ratho. Built as part of the original canal, it’s a fine example of early 19th-century civil engineering.

- **Ratho Village & Quarry History**: Ratho itself has ancient roots — with Bronze Age and Neolithic artefacts found nearby — and became a thriving spot once the canal arrived. The adjacent Ratho Quarry supplied stone for the canal and for Edinburgh’s New Town and today stands as a reminder of the area’s industrial past before becoming a modern climbing arena.

## Notes

- **Cafes, Restaurants, Pubs, and Grocery Shops**:
  - There's a Sainsbury's at the starting point.
  - Shops in Broxburn are a short detour from the route.
  - `The Bridge Inn` at Ratho is a good stop for a drink. If you are planing to eat here, book ahead.
- **Public Toilets**: Winchburgh Sainsbury's. There is a Lidl and a Aldi at Broxburn. No public toilets in Ratho.
- **Safety**: Watch for cyclists on the towpath; most are considerate, but stay alert.
- **Wildlife**: Look out for kingfishers, herons, and other waterfowl along the canal.
