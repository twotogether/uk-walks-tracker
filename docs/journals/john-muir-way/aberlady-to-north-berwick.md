## Notes

- **Cafes, Restaurants, Pubs, and Grocery Shops**: 
  - Grocery shops, cafes, and pubs in Aberlady. We really like `The Old Bakehouse Tearoom`.
  - Cafes in Gullane. We had a tasty cardamom knot from `No 10 Bakery`. `Cherish Vintage Tearoom & Emporium` looked lovely.
  - There is also a cafe, a garden centre, and a sauna in Archerfield.
  - Lots of excellent cafes and eateries in North Berwick. We love `Bostock` and `Lobster Shack`.
- **Public Toilets**: Public toilets in Gullane, Dirleton, Yellowcraigs, and North Berwick.
- **Wildlife**: We spotted deer in Archerfield, and seals near Longniddry on the bus back. Also lots and lots of birds! It was a beautiful day.
